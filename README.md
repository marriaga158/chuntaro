A terribly written and formatted Discord bot that I wrote instead of doing homework.

This is mostly an exercise in figuring out how to use the new Discord slash commands since I heard somewhere that the old way of using prefixes to interact with bots was being deprecated.

This bot's main functionality is to remind people to get on to play Valorant since everybody conveniently "forgets to get on" because they're lame, but I'm probably going to build on this as my own personal utility bot.

If you somehow stumble your way upon this code, that means you're either scraping for bot tokens or you're a future employer of mine! Hello! If you are a future employer, please note that this is my first time touching js since like, 7th grade and is not indicative of my actual programming skill.

also please hire me
